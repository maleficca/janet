# Adding shortcut to Janet
While you can operate Janet by starting the application from the Add-Ins tab, it is not the fastest way to do it.
In order to speed up this process, it's recommended to add a keyboard shortcut to Janet in Revit:

1. Click on the `File` tab in the Revit ribbon.
2. Select `Options`. Revit options window should show up.
3. Navigate to `User Interface` tab in the navigation list on the left.
4. Press the `Customize` button for the `Keyboard Shortcuts` option.
5. Search for "Janet" in the search input.
6. Select the `Janet` command.
7. Click on the `Press new keys` input, press keyboard button (We recommend `J` for `Janet`!) and click `Assign` button.
8. Click `OK` button. Your shortcut is assigned now and you should be able to start Janet by pressing your configured shortcut!
